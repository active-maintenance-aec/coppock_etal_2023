# coppock_etal_2023/download_original.R
# Output: original/ (the deposited replication archive, not redistributed here)
# Depends on: original_manifest.csv
# Description: Fetch the deposited archive from Harvard Dataverse and verify every
#   file. Run this once before running anything in maintained/. Re-running is
#   free: files already present with the right checksum are not downloaded again.
#
#   The manifest carries two checksums per file. md5_served is the MD5 of the
#   bytes Dataverse returns for ?format=original, which is what this code was
#   written against. md5_published is the checksum Dataverse displays. Here all
#   63 agree, but they do not always: another deposit in this program carries
#   three published checksums that verify neither the original file nor the
#   tabular file derived from it. Verification therefore runs against md5_served
#   and any disagreement is printed rather than raised as a failure.
#
#   The deposit has directory structure. Files sit under code/, data/ and
#   fitted_models/, with README.txt and six standalone scripts at the top level,
#   and the manifest carries the directory in the file name.
